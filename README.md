# IMDb Movie Review Sentinment Classifier
Deep learning model in Keras used to classify sentiment on movie reviews from IMDb. This repo is still a work in progress.

To do:

1. Clean up code - partially done

2. Add explanation text - partially done

3. Try different model - First tried only dense layers, now trying 1D convolution layers.

3. Use GloVe word embeddings - Not tried, using embedding layer that gets trained.

4. Implement prediction for users own review - Done.
